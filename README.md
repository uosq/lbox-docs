# Hi

This is NOT the official docs :skull\_crossbones:

Here are some cool stuff you might like

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If a method or function doesn't have "()" (parenthesis), then it doesn't have parameters, but you still need the parenthesis

**Methods are called directly from the object (Called with : )**

**Functions are called with a library (Called with . )**

Just a friendly reminder:

<mark style="color:green;">**If a text is GREEN, it is important and you should probably read it**</mark>

Im using LuaLS's annotations
